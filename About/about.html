      <p>
        During my early childhood living in a quiet isolated rural area outside
        of a small town in Illinois surrounded by corn fields, meadows and
        highways. Most days, I would ride my bike to the edge of my street and
        gaze at the many trucks and cars that would wiz by and imagining the
        cities and adventures that awaits them. Meanwhile, my imagination never
        ceased even in the quiet confines of my room where I would play with my
        dolls giving them complicated characters to enact in my cardboard-made
        dollhouse. My dreams of acting and creating never stopped. It is what my
        soul craves and needs to survive. My name is JassyBlu. I am a creative
        artist; a thespian with a flair for designing using imagery from the
        deepest depths of my imagination to bring inspiration and wonder to
        those who are fortunate to view my work.
