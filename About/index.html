      <h1 class="heading-title">My Story</h1>
      <p>During my early childhood living in a rural area outside of a small town
        in Illinois surrounded by corn fields, meadows and an Interstate highway
        that would have a rapid succession of trucks and cars. I would ride my
        bike to the edge of it, gaze at them as they whizzed by, imagining which
        big cities they would be heading to. Meanwhile, my imagination never
        ceased even in the quiet confines of my room where I would play with my
        dolls and create stories which they would bring the characters to life.
        My dreams of acting and creating never stopped. It is what my soul
        craves and needs to survive. My name is JassyBlu. I am a creative
        artist; a thespian with a flair for designing using imagery from the
        deepest depths of my imagination to bring inspiration and wonder to
        those who are fortunate to view my work on canvas or on stage.
